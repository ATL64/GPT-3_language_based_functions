This leaves us with a tie between \"the law should go through\" and \"the lae shouldn't be part of the constitution.\" If we take into account that one instance of each appeared alongside another response (for example, \"'The law should get the greenlight,' said John\"), we can see that neither has a clear majority.

       "3   The answer to \"Should congress pass the law?\" is that the law should get the greenlight. This is because three out of five answers say that the law should go through, be passed, or receive a green light. The other two answers are more split, with one saying it shouldn't be part of the constitution and another saying it shouldn't be implemented - these could mean a number of things and are less clear than the first three answers. Therefore, by process of elimination, Congress passing the law is most likely what people want to happen.
